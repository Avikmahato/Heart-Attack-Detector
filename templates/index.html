            <p>"Thank you for sharing these values with me. I've reviewed your information: your age, gender, heart
                rate, blood pressure readings (systolic and diastolic), blood sugar, and importantly, your CK-MB and
                Troponin levels.</p>
            <p>Based on these numbers, particularly the elevated CK-MB and Troponin, we need to consider the possibility
                of a cardiac event. These specific markers are proteins released into the bloodstream when there's
                damage to the heart muscle.</p>
            <p>What this means: While these results are concerning and strongly suggest that your heart has been under
                stress, they don't definitively tell us the extent of the damage or what caused it. A 'heart attack
                chance' as you put it, is certainly something we're evaluating very closely right now.</p>
            <p class="fw-bold fs-5">Next Steps (and this is crucial):</p>
            <ol>
                <li><span class="fw-bold">Immediate Evaluation:</span> We need to get you admitted to the hospital right
                    away. This is not something we can monitor from home.</li>
                <li><span class="fw-bold">Further Tests:</span> We'll perform an electrocardiogram (ECG) to look at your
                    heart's electrical activity, and likely more blood tests to track the trend of your cardiac markers.
                    We may also consider an echocardiogram to look at your heart's structure and function, and
                    potentially a cardiac catheterization to visualize your coronary arteries.</li>
                <li><span class="fw-bold">Diagnosis:</span> Our priority is to confirm whether you've had a heart
                    attack, and if so, determine its severity and the best course of treatment.</li>
                <li><span class="fw-bold">Treatment:</span> Depending on the diagnosis, treatment could range from
                    medication to procedures like angioplasty or bypass surgery. Our goal will be to restore blood flow
                    to your heart muscle and prevent further damage</li>
            </ol>
            <p><span class="fw-bold">What you should do now:</span> Please remain calm. We have a team ready to take
                care of you. Avoid any strenuous activity. We will move quickly to ensure you receive the best possible
                care. Do you have any questions right now?"</p>
